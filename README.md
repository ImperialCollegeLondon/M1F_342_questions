# M1F Week 3 Problems class question

Dr Britnell gave a system of axioms and asked two questions about it: how to prove P -> P and how to prove P -> not not P. 

I (KMB) thought it would be interesting to work on these questions in Lean. Gabriel Ebner wrote a general framework for us, I put an example of usage in the framework and added my proof of 6a. At the time of writing, 6b is still open.
