# M1F Week 3 Problems class question

Dr Britnell gave a system of axioms and asked two questions about it: how to prove P -> P and how to prove P -> not not P. 

I (KMB) thought it would be interesting to work on these questions in Lean. Gabriel Ebner wrote a general framework for us, I put an example of usage in the framework and added my proof of 6a. Several students have now done 6b, as have some other people. All the results are in the `src/` directory.
