# M1F problems class questions from room 342

These are some Lean-related thoughts on the questions on the extra sheets which we went through in room 342. At the minute we have stuff related to the sheets for 2018 week 3 (`Logic`), 2018 week 7 (`Dedekind_cuts`), 2018 week 11 (`Cantor`), and 2017 week 4 (`Rational_Powers`) (which I don't think we did in 2018).

See the README's in the directories in `src` for more information.
